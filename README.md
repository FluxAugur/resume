# Nathanial L. McConnell
## Superhero for Hire
### Developing a Better Tomorrow, Source by Source
Problem solver. Geek. Ideaveloper. Code artist. Storyteller. Believer in automation. Lover of games and the creative process. Font of useless (sometimes useful) knowledge. Idles poorly. Currently obsessed with improving dotfiles and development environment VMs.

Focused on developing solutions to interesting and diverse technical and intellectual problems. Loves to flex mental muscles. Seeks (and thrives) in any environment that encourages devising new approaches, new ideas, and new projects, and pushes the limits of my creativity.

> Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of 'crack-pot'​ than the stigma of conformity. And on issues that seem important to you, stand up and be counted at any cost.
